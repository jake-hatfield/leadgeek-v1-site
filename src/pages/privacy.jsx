          It is our policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we

          you may provide us through the Website. We have adopted this privacy
          policy to explain what information may be collected on our Website,

        <p className="mt-4 text-gray-700">
          Like most website operators, {siteTitle} collects
          non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers
          and servers typically make available, such as the browser type,
          language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each
          visitor request. {siteTitle}'s purpose in collecting non-personally
          identifying information is to better understand how {siteTitle}'s
          visitors use its website. From time to time, {siteTitle} may release
          non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by
          publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
        </p>

          Gathering of personally-identifying information
        </h2>
        <p className="mt-4 text-gray-700">
          Certain visitors to {siteTitle}'s websites choose to interact with{" "}
          {siteTitle} in ways that require {siteTitle} to gather
          personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information
          that {siteTitle} gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For
          example, we ask visitors who sign up for our services to provide an
          email address.
        </p>
        <h2 className="mt-6 text-xl font-bold">Security</h2>
        <p className="mt-4 text-gray-700">
          The security of your personal information is important to us, but
          remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method
          of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use
          commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we
          cannot guarantee its absolute security.

          Our service may contain links to external sites that are not operated
          by us. If you click on a third party link, you will be directed to
          that third party's site. We strongly advise you to review the privacy
