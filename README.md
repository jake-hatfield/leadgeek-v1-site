# Leadgeek

This was the marketing website for Leadgeekâ€™s core product for nearly 2 years, which is an online arbitrage sourcing list for Amazon sellers.

I built it using Gatsby.js and decided to publicize the repo since it's a now-deprecated product for Leadgeek.

This code is not to be reproduced and is intended for Leadgeek purposes only.
